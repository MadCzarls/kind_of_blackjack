Kind of blackjack, according to the rules we used to have when we play in my 
home ;]. Your score has to be higher than another player and as close to the 
21 points as possible. Having more then 21 points means failure, loss, defeat, game over.

Having 21 points with ten and ace means "natural twenty-one (pl: "oczko")" 
and it beats another player"s 21 points if the latter consists of with more than two cards.

The one exception when you can have more then 21 is having two aces 
(22 points) and that means you have "blackjack (pl: "perskie oczko")" which beats
"natural twenty-one". Having more than 21 points in the rest of cases means 
"going bust/busting (pl: "fura")" which is game over and means defeat for this player, 
even if the second one hasn"t made his/hers turn yet. That"s why you should 
play two matches (or even number of them) each time.
